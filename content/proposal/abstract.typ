= Abstract

Apollon is a UML Diagram Editor designed to help students create diagrams easily. However, it has usability issues and separate development for web and mobile, making it harder to use and maintain. This thesis focuses on reengineering the codebase into one unified system for both platforms to make it easier to manage and ensure consistent functionality. The main goal is to improve usability, learnability, and visibility for a better user experience. By making Apollon simpler and more user-friendly, students will be able to create diagrams more easily and effectively.
