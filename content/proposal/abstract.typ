= Abstract

This thesis aims to make the Apollon UML Diagram Editor easier to use and improve its design by fixing problems and adding new features. We start by explaining how few people currently use Apollon because it's hard to use. We identify specific issues with how it works on both computers and mobile devices. The motivation section discusses why it's important to solve these issues to get more people to use the program consistently. The main part of the thesis will focus on redesigning the interface, fixing the most important bugs, and adding advanced tools for drawing diagrams.

The goals of this thesis are to improve the program's design on both web and iOS platforms, fix major issues, and set up a system to keep making it better based on what users say. We plan to keep testing and refining the program by listening to user feedback. In the end, this thesis will help make Apollon more user-friendly and easier to access, making diagramming smoother and more straightforward for students.
