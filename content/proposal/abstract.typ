This thesis aims to enhance the usability and user experience of the Apollon UML Diagram Editor by improving its interface, fixing bugs, and introducing new features. The introduction presents the Apollon UML Editor, highlighting its low adoption rates due to usability issues. The problem section identifies specific challenges with the current user interface, particularly in how users interact with both the web and mobile versions. In the motivation chapter, the importance of addressing these usability concerns to improve adoption and consistency is discussed. The objectives of this thesis include enhancing the user interface for both web and iOS platforms, resolving critical bugs, introducing advanced diagram editing tools, and establishing a feedback loop for continuous improvement. These steps will help to explore the process of UI redesign, bug prioritization, feature development, and feedback integration. Finally, the schedule outlines the step-by-step timeline for achieving these goals, with a focus on iterative testing and refinement. By addressing these areas, this thesis will result in a more user-friendly and accessible tool for students in software development.
