= Abstract


This thesis aims to enhance the usability and user experience of the Apollon UML Diagram Editor by improving its user interface (UI), fixing bugs, and adding new features to make it more intuitive for both new and experienced users. Currently, Apollon faces low adoption rates due to issues with its interface and the overall user experience. By addressing these problems, this thesis will improve the platformâ€™s effectiveness and accessibility, benefiting students and professionals in software development.

In addition to usability improvements, this thesis focuses on enhancing the code quality and modernizing the project by integrating the latest technologies and libraries. The objectives include rearranging the application bar, refining the UI for iOS, identifying and fixing critical bugs, introducing advanced diagram editing tools, and establishing a user feedback loop to ensure continuous improvement. The study will target both web and mobile platforms, ensuring consistency and adaptability across devices, with usability testing and feedback analysis guiding these improvements to meet real user needs and lead to long-term adoption
