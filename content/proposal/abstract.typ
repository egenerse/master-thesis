= Abstract

Apollon is a UML Diagram Editor that helps students create diagrams easily. However, usability issues and separate development for web and mobile make the tool harder to use and maintain. This thesis reengineers the codebase into a unified system for both platforms to simplify management and ensure consistent functionality. The main goal improves usability, learnability, and visibility to create a better user experience. Simplifying Apollon and making it more user-friendly allows students to create diagrams more easily and effectively.
