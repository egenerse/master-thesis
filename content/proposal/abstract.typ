This thesis aims to enhance the usability and user experience of the Apollon UML Diagram Editor by improving its interface, fixing bugs, and introducing new features. The introduction presents the Apollon UML Editor, emphasizing its low adoption rates due to various usability issues. The problem section identifies specific challenges in the current interface, particularly in how users interact with the web and mobile versions. In the motivation chapter, the importance of addressing these usability concerns to boost adoption and consistency is discussed. Key chapters cover the process of UI redesign, bug prioritization, and feature development, along with the introduction of advanced diagram editing tools.

The objectives of this thesis include improving the interface for both web and iOS platforms, resolving critical bugs, and establishing a feedback loop for continuous improvement. A focus on iterative testing and refinement, driven by user feedback, will guide these enhancements. Ultimately, this thesis will make Apollon more user-friendly and accessible, benefiting students by providing a smoother, more intuitive diagramming experience.
