The thesis will start on 16.12.2024 and will consist of 8 iterations ending on 16.06.2025.

*Iteration 1 (4 weeks: 16.12.2024 - 13.01.2025):*
Set up a monorepo structure to include the web application, library, server application, and shared configurations, providing a unified and maintainable architecture. Begin implementing the core components of the class diagram using function-based React, as outlined in Section 4.1. Set up React Flow to manage class diagram layouts and interactions.

*Iteration 2 (3 weeks: 14.01.2025 - 03.02.2025):*
Implement inline editing for class diagram elements and introduce shortcuts for common actions to improve usability and visibility, as detailed in Section 4.3. Customize path creation to enhance diagramming flexibility. Make key features, such as creating new diagrams and importing/exporting files visible on the main screen. Conduct usability testing for the implemented features to ensure smooth interactions and address potential user pain points.

*Iteration 3 (3 weeks: 04.02.2025 - 24.02.2025):*
Use Capacitor to wrap the unified codebase into native apps for iOS and Android, as described in Section 4.2. Add touch gesture support for mobile browsers and apps to enable smooth interactions. Refine mobile layouts for a touch-friendly interface and resolve inconsistencies between web and mobile applications. Perform cross-platform testing to verify consistent functionality and user experience across web and mobile platforms.

*Iteration 4 (3 weeks: 25.02.2025 - 17.03.2025):*
Extend diagram support by implementing use case diagrams and enhancing functionality for remaining diagram types, such as component, activity, object, and deployment diagrams, as outlined in Sections 4.1 and 4.3. Ensure these diagrams meet usability and visibility standards established for class diagrams. Create templates for the new diagram types. Conduct functional testing for all diagram types to ensure correctness and reliability.

*Iteration 5 (3 weeks: 18.03.2025 - 07.04.2025):*
Develop collaboration mode to support real-time updates for multiple users and finalize assessment mode for evaluating diagrams, as detailed in Section 4.3. Ensure the system accurately reflects changes made by one user for others. Perform integration testing to validate real-time updates, collaboration functionality, and library management features.

*Iteration 6 (3 weeks: 08.04.2025 - 28.04.2025):*
Focus on integrating Apollon with Artemis while keeping the same API and JSON format, requiring no to minimal adaptions in Artemis. Add offline diagramming features to allow the app to work without an internet connection. Improve the code for better performance and consistency across platforms. Conduct system testing to check performance, stability, and offline functionality, ensuring everything works smoothly.

*Iteration 7 (3 weeks: 29.04.2025 - 19.05.2025):*
Collect user feedback on implemented features and address usability issues and bugs, as described in all sections. Refine and finalize components based on feedback to improve overall system quality. Perform acceptance testing to ensure the application meets user expectations and quality standards.

*Iteration 8 (4 weeks: 20.05.2025 - 16.06.2025):*
Focus on finalizing the project documentation and writing the thesis. Create detailed documentation for the codebase, features, and user guide. Summarize the research, development process, and outcomes in the thesis, marking the completion of the project.
