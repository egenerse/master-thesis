= Problem

A significant issue with the current state of the Apollon UML Diagram Editor is that many students are either unaware of its existence or choose not to use it for their theses. As a result, students frequently opt for other tools and websites to create their UML diagrams, leading to inconsistencies in the tools and diagram formats used across projects. This lack of usage suggests that Apollon may not be adequately promoted or user-friendly enough to attract widespread usage among students.

Several factors may contribute to this problem. First, Apollonâ€™s user interface might not be intuitive or accessible enough, which can lead to confusion and frustration for new users @Intechnic2023. Some students may find it challenging to discover and understand where all the features are located, especially when compared to alternative tools that they are more familiar with @Ferreira2024.

Similarly, the iOS application, while available for mobile devices and tablets, also presents several usability challenges. The current design requires users to click multiple times to perform basic actions, such as replacing elements, which limits the flexibility and efficiency of the tool. Compared to other UML diagramming applications, Apollon is less adaptable and not open to easy customization.

Additionally, the interface on iOS hides essential sections, such as diagram and component options, making it difficult for users to quickly find and modify their diagrams. This lack of accessibility in both the web and mobile versions of Apollon discourages students from using the tool, further contributing to its underutilization.

@renameActivityDiagram serves as an example of how the current user interface can be improved, demonstrating that users currently need to take multiple unnecessary actions to perform simple tasks, like renaming an element, which could be simplified.
