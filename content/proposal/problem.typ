= Problem

A significant issue with the current state of the Apollon UML Diagram Editor is that many students are either unaware of its existence or choose not to use it for their theses. As a result, students frequently opt for other tools and websites to create their UML diagrams, leading to inconsistencies in the tools and diagram formats used across projects. This lack of usage suggests that Apollon may not be adequately promoted or user-friendly enough to attract widespread usage among students.

Several factors may contribute to this problem. First, Apollonâ€™s user interface might not be intuitive or accessible enough, which can lead to confusion and frustration for new users @Intechnic2023. Some students may find it challenging to discover and understand where all the features are located, especially when compared to alternative tools that they are more familiar with @Ferreira2024. Additionally, usability bugs in the interface can further discourage students from using the tool, as they may find it inconvenient or unreliable for their diagramming needs.

This lack of awareness and poor user experience often leads them to prefer other, more accessible tools, undermining the goal of standardizing UML diagram creation through Apollon.

@renameActivityDiagram serves as an example of how the current user interface can be improved, demonstrating that users currently need to take multiple unnecessary actions to perform simple tasks, like renaming an element, which could be simplified.
