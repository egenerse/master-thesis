= Motivation
The primary goal is to improve the Apollon UML Diagram Editor and increase its awareness among students. To achieve this, the platform needs to become more user-friendly, which can be accomplished by fixing existing bugs, gathering more feedback from users, and introducing new features that enhance usability. These improvements will create a smoother UML diagramming experience, making Apollon a valuable tool for students @HUI20151932.


A well-designed user experience (UX) and interface are essential in educational technology, as they encourage students to engage more with the platform @su15107923. By providing a more intuitive and user-friendly interface, students can focus on mastering UML concepts without being held back by technical difficulties. When all students use the same tool, it also simplifies the review and assessment process for professors.
