The primary goal is to improve the Apollon UML Diagram Editor and increase its awareness among students. To achieve this, the platform needs to become more user-friendly, which can be accomplished by fixing existing bugs, gathering more feedback from users, and introducing new features that enhance usability. These improvements will create a smoother UML diagramming experience, making Apollon a valuable tool for students @HUI20151932.


A well-designed user experience (UX) and interface are essential in educational technology, as they encourage students to engage more with the platform @su15107923. By providing a more intuitive and user-friendly interface, students can focus on mastering UML concepts without being held back by technical difficulties. When all students use the same tool, it also simplifies the review and assessment process for professors.

In addition to refining the web-based version of Apollon, this thesis will extend these improvements to mobile platforms by developing an iOS application for both iPad and iOS mobile phones. This strategic extension is informed by the growing dependency on mobile devices in education, which underscores the necessity for multi-platform availability to augment the effectiveness of educational tools. Embracing mobile platforms aims to make UML diagramming more accessible, convenient, and adaptable to the diverse needs of modern students, thereby enhancing the educational experience across different user environments @mobileEduTech2023.

The success of this project could serve as a model for future educational technology developments, demonstrating the critical impact of cross-platform consistency in learning tools.
