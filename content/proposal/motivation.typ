The primary goal of this thesis focuses on improving Apollon’s accessibility and usability for students while addressing critical technical challenges. Modernizing the codebase and adopting a function-based architecture with React Flow establishes a unified and maintainable system. This approach increases the tool’s reliability, reduces bugs, and enhances the developer experience, making Apollon easier to maintain and extend in the future. A more modern architecture also ensures scalability, aligning with best practices in educational technology @su15107923.

Using UML effectively is important for understanding software designs, especially for learners new to complex systems @ambler2005elements. A redesigned UI and simpler interactions will improve both usability and learnability, aligning with Nielsen’s usability heuristics @nielsen1995usability. Using Capacitor to ensure consistent functionality across web and mobile platforms also supports flexibility and efficiency, highlighting the importance of mobile accessibility in education. This project aims to make Apollon more accessible, learnable, and effective, benefiting more students and setting a standard for educational software.
