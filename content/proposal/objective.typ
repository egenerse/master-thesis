= Objective

As outlined, this thesis focuses on reengineering the Apollon UML Diagram Editor with the following goals:


*1.Rewrite the codebase using the latest React standards* to improve maintainability and scalability.

*2.Enhance accessibility across web and mobile platforms* for consistent usability.

*3.Improve user experience in usability and visibility* by streamlining workflows and enhancing feature accessibility.

== Rewrite the Codebase Using Latest React Standards

The first phase focuses on reengineering the codebase by switching to functional components and the latest React standards. This will make the system easier to maintain, scale, and debug, creating a strong base for future updates. Adopting a function-based structure will replace the limitations of the current class-based design and allow for smoother development.

React Flow will be used to manage diagram components and interactions, simplifying complex tasks and improving the user experience. The updated codebase will follow modern React practices to ensure consistency and clarity.

== Enhance Accessibility Across Web and Mobile Platforms

This goal focuses on improving accessibility by using Capacitor to create a unified codebase for both web and native applications. Capacitor wraps the web app to function as native apps for iOS and Android, eliminating the need for separate codebases. This simplifies maintenance and ensures a consistent experience across all devices.

The project will add touch gestures, including drag-and-drop and hand gestures, to improve usability for mobile users and web browsers. These features will make interactions smoother and create a better user experience, allowing users to work easily on mobile devices.

== Improve User Experience in Usability and Visibility

This phase focuses on making the editor more intuitive by simplifying workflows and improving the accessibility of key features. Enhancements will include shortcuts for common tasks, enabling experienced users to perform actions quickly. Inline editing for diagram elements will replace unnecessary popups, reducing friction and improving efficiency. These changes aim to provide a smoother, more user-friendly experience for both novice and advanced users.

To enhance visibility, customization options for path creation will be introduced, allowing for more expressive and flexible diagramming. Key features such as creating new diagrams, importing/exporting files, and accessing collaboration mode will be made prominently visible on the main screen. These adjustments ensure that essential functionalities are easily discoverable and accessible, reducing the learning curve and improving overall usability.
