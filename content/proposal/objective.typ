== Enhance UI/UX  <obj-4-1-1>

=== Rearranging the Application Bar for Web 
To improve the user experience on the web platform, the application bar will be reorganized to enhance usability. The layout will be adapted to improve access to core functions and providing a cleaner design.

=== Refining the UI Design for iOS
For iOS, the UI will be adjusted to accommodate touch-based interactions, improving the user experience on mobile and tablet devices. Elements will be optimized for smaller screens, ensuring seamless interactions.

== Fix Bugs Impacting User Experience

===  Identifying and Prioritizing Critical Bugs
This subsection focuses on the process of bug identification and prioritization. Bugs that hinder critical features, such as adding new element, editing, or resizing the canvas, will be identified and fixed to ensure smooth operation.

=== Monitoring and Addressing Recurring Issues
To ensure long-term stability, tests will be created to prevent regression after bug fixes. This will help maintain a reliable user experience across future updates of both the web and iOS versions of the tool.

== Introduce New Features for Improved Usability

=== Advanced Diagram Editing Tools
New tools will be introduced to make diagram creation more efficient, such as shortcut features and enhanced diagram manipulation capabilities. These tools will be designed to meet the needs of both novice and advanced users.

=== Platform-Specific Enhancements
Features that cater specifically to the strengths of web and iOS platforms will be developed. For example, web-based users may benefit from better keyboard shortcuts, while iOS users may have access to gesture-based interactions.

== Establish a User Feedback Loop

===  Gathering Usability Data from Real Users
Surveys, interviews, and usability tests will be conducted to gather feedback on the current state of the editor. The focus will be on both students and educators to ensure the tool meets their needs.

=== Iterative Improvement Based on Feedback
The gathered feedback will be analyzed, and further refinements will be made to the UI, functionality, and performance of the tool. This iterative process will help improve user adoption and satisfaction across both platforms.
