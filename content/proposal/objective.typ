= Objective

The objectives of the proposed thesis are as follows.

== Enhance UI/UX  <obj-4-1>

The user experience on the web platform will be improved by reorganizing the application toolbar to enhance usability. Access to core functions will be streamlined, and the layout will be simplified to provide a cleaner design.

For iOS devices, the interface will be adjusted to better accommodate touch-based interactions, enhancing the user experience on mobile and tablet devices. Elements will be optimized for smaller screens, ensuring seamless interactions.

== Fix Bugs Impacting User Experience

This section will focus on the identification and prioritization of significant bugs that impact usability in both the web and iOS versions of the tool. Issues such as adding new elements, editing, or resizing the canvas, which are common to both platforms, will be systematically addressed. For the iOS application, specific problems include translation errors, drag-and-drop functionalities, difficulties in selecting elements, and visibility issues with methods and attributes in the edit view. These issues currently prevent the application from being effectively used by students.

For the web version, similar usability concerns that disrupt the smooth creation and management of diagrams will also be identified and resolved. This comprehensive approach ensures that both platforms provide a seamless user experience.

To ensure long-term stability and prevent the recurrence of these issues, rigorous testing protocols will be implemented. These tests will be designed to detect and address any regressions that occur after the initial bug fixes, maintaining a reliable user experience through future updates of both the web and iOS versions of the tool.

== Introduce New Features for Improved Usability

New tools will be introduced to make diagram creation more efficient, such as shortcut features and enhanced diagram manipulation capabilities. These tools will be designed to meet the needs of both novice and advanced users.

Features that cater specifically to the strengths of web and iOS platforms will be developed. For example, web-based users may benefit from better keyboard shortcuts, while iOS users may have access to gesture-based interactions.

After the initial bug fixes, we will carefully review feedback from students to determine which new features are most needed for creating UML diagrams on both the web and iOS platforms. This feedback will guide us in choosing the most important tools to add or improve. By focusing on what students find most useful, we can ensure that the new features make diagram creation easier and more efficient for everyone, regardless of whether they use the web or iOS version.

== Establish a User Feedback Loop

Surveys, interviews, and usability tests will be conducted to gather feedback on the current state of the editor. The focus will be on both students and educators to ensure the tool meets their needs.

The gathered feedback will be analyzed, and further refinements will be made to the UI, functionality, and performance of the tool. This iterative process will help improve user adoption and satisfaction across both platforms.
