= Introduction

Apollon #footnote[https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon] is an open-source UML Diagram Editor integrated into Artemis, a platform widely used for interactive learning and assessments @krusche2018artemis. It provides students with a tool to create and edit UML diagrams, facilitating a better understanding of software systems and their design. As Fowler (2003) highlights, UML is not just a design tool but also a communication medium, enabling better understanding and collaboration @fowler2003uml. As part of a learning environment, Apollon plays a crucial role in helping students visualize and communicate complex software concepts, making it an essential resource for both teaching and learning.

This thesis focuses on modernizing Apollon to address its outdated codebase and usability challenges. The project involves rewriting the editor from scratch using React Flow to improve maintainability and scalability. Additionally, Capacitor will be employed to enhance mobile accessibility, ensuring a seamless experience across web and mobile platforms. Key improvements include enhancing the user interface and ensuring consistent interactions, with the ultimate goal of creating a user-friendly and efficient tool to support students in their learning processes.
