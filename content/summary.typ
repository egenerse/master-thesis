= Summary
#TODO[
  This chapter includes the status of your thesis, a conclusion and an outlook about future work.
]

This chapter summarizes what goals have been implemented as part of this thesis. We will discuss which goals have not or only been partially fulfilled and what is required to complete them. Furthermore we will mention future work which will improve the UI test suite and its integration into the development workflow.

== Status
#TODO[
  Describe honestly the achieved goals (e.g. the well implemented and tested use cases) and the open goals here. if you only have achieved goals, you did something wrong in your analysis.
]
This section explains the current status of the UI test suite. To evaluate which goals have been fulfilled and what still needs to be improved we assign the goals one of the following icons.All requirements defined in Section 4.2 and their status are listed in table 5.1.
The filled circle indicates a full achievement of the goal
The half filled circle indicates a partial achievement of the goal
The empty circle indicates no achievement of the goal
#stack(
  // Filled half-circle (left)
  align(left, rect(width: 1cm, height: 1cm, fill: black)),
  // Full circle outline
  circle(radius: 0.5cm, stroke: 1pt),
)


=== Realized Goals
#TODO[
  Summarize the achieved goals by repeating the realized requirements or use cases stating how you realized them.
]

=== Open Goals
#TODO[
  Summarize the open goals by repeating the open requirements or use cases and explaining why you were not able to achieve them. Important: It might be suspicious, if you do not have open goals. This usually indicates that you did not thoroughly analyze your problems.
]

== Conclusion
#TODO[
  Recap shortly which problem you solved in your thesis and discuss your *contributions* here.
]

== Future Work

  Tell us the next steps (that you would do if you have more time). Be creative, visionary and open-minded here.
