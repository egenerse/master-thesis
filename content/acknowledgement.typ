We would like to take a moment to thank everyone who supported us throughout the journey of writing this thesis.

First and foremost, our sincere gratitude goes to Prof. Dr. Stephan Krusche, our advisor and supervisor. His continuous support and sharp, constructive feedback were invaluable to us. He helped us understand how to structure our work in a meaningful way: from planning sprints more effectively, to thinking ahead about integration strategies and conducting thorough research before jumping into implementation. His advice helped us avoid common pitfalls and ensured that our process was as thoughtful and efficient as possible.

We are especially thankful to Felix T.J. Dietrich, our second advisor, for guiding us through both the research and development phases. His support during our weekly meetings helped us grow week by week, both technically and academically. His feedback always improved us to refine our ideas and think deeper.

Weâ€™re also very grateful to Patrick Bassner for his help during the technology exploration phase of our proof of concept your insights and input really helped shape the direction of our work.

A heartfelt thank you goes out to our families and friends for their patience, encouragement, and emotional support during this intense period.
